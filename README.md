My first React with Tailwind web application with help of the internet and ChatGPT.

I used the internet and ChatGPT in some situations, mostly for Tailwind and CSS design stuff, but implementing features required the help of many forums.
Throughout, I struggled with different implementations. 

1. I will start with the responsive design; it was my first time implementing it with Tailwind, so I was not sure how to use it. However, it is surprisingly easy once you know how to do it.
2. Beyond that, I struggled with the header at the top. It took me hours to find the right forum to help me fix it. I wanted to stop, but then I came up with a brilliant idea: "Hey, why don't you make the header stick to the top when you scroll up?" Other websites have that too. That is when the JavaScript stuff really got to me in combination with the React features. Eventually, it worked out; it took me a couple of hours, but now I appreciate it much more.
3. Another challenge was implementing the functionality where, if you click on Testimonials or Contact, it scrolls down. The hard part was implementing this while also ensuring that if you click on Properties, which opens a "different page" (at least for the user), then pressing Contact or Testimonials should take you back to page 1 and scroll down. That was a struggle.
4. The last issue, but really fun, was implementing a little Easter egg. I struggled with the implementation; right now, I would not be able to redo it out of thin air because I already forgot the syntax, but eventually, I got the hang of it and put the puzzle together.

Final words:

1. There are many things I learned today. When it came to various issues, the trick was mostly to reduce the complexity of my ideas. That way, it was easier to find a user who had the same issue.
2. Tailwind is absolutely awesome.
3. I am content with the result.
4. A huge thank you to those people who write answers on pages like Reddit.
